## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    Ground clearance and vehicle length are the two variables that provided the most amount of random variance. On the otherside, you have vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD which had a non-random amount of variance. 
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    Because our p-value is less than 0.05 we know thatt the slope is not zero. 
3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
    While there are a few other factors that are not in our dataset that contribute to the MPG variability, we know t hat our R-squared value is 71% which means the model will correctly predict MPG values 71% of the time.

## Summary Statics on Suspension Coils
1. The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
   Of the three lots, Lot 1 and 2 both are within design specifications while having a similar mean and median. Lot 3 on the other hand go over the manufacture specs and has a lot of variance.
